# Café Central · Admin

Frontend-only prototype of the Café Central staff back-office, built from the Pencil exports in
`exports/` (1440×900 desktop frames). There is no backend: auth and data are mocks in
`src/mocks/`.

## Run it

```bash
npm install
npm run dev      # http://localhost:3000
```

Checks: `npm run lint`, `npx tsc --noEmit`, `npm test`, `npm run build`.

## Demo credentials

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Email | `turno@cafecentral.com` |
| Password | `Mostrador2026!` |
| MFA code | `123456` |

Flow: `/login` → `/verify` (MFA) → `/` (overview). The admin routes redirect to `/login`
until the MFA step is completed. "Recordarme en este dispositivo" keeps the mock session in
`localStorage`; otherwise it lives in `sessionStorage` and ends with the tab. To sign out,
clear the site storage.

## Structure

- `src/app/(auth)` — auth screens with the split brand layout.
- `src/app/(admin)` — authenticated shell (sidebar + top bar) and modules.
- `src/features/<feature>` — screens, presentational components and pure helpers (with tests).
- `src/shared/ui`, `src/shared/lib` — reusable primitives and utilities.
- `src/mocks` — typed mock data and mock auth.
  - `src/mocks/service-day` — the single "service day" (21/10/2026 at 14:42) that 10A, 02, 03, 04 and
    05 derive their rows and metrics from: tables sessions, orders, bill requests, collections, the
    product catalogue (also the 07 products screen: categories, moments, options, images in
    `public/images/products` copied from the customer app by `scripts/copy-product-images.mjs`;
    and the 08 menu organization: moment and category metadata, moment covers in
    `public/images/moments` copied by `scripts/copy-moment-images.mjs`; counts are always derived),
    staff and the 06 payment method / request mode names. `service-day.test.ts`
    checks that the screens agree with each other. Some numbers differ from the exports on purpose
    (see `odd/tasks/admin-mock-unification.md`). Each screen keeps its in-memory actions to itself,
    except the venue configuration below.
  - `src/features/venue` — the shared venue store (`useSyncExternalStore`): spaces and tables
    seeded from the service day and edited in Gestión de mesas, read by `/tables`,
    `/tables/management` and `/tables/qr`. It lives in memory for the browser session: client
    navigation keeps the changes, a full reload starts again from the seed (the server and the
    hydration render always use the seed).
  - `src/mocks/payments.ts` — the saved 06 payment configuration.

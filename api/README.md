# Central Perk API

Backend shared by `admin/` and `web/`. NestJS 12 (ESM), Prisma 7 with PostgreSQL, Zod 4, Vitest.

## Setup

Requires Node 22+ and Docker.

```bash
cd api
cp .env.example .env
docker compose up -d          # PostgreSQL 17 on localhost:5432 (or POSTGRES_PORT)
npm ci                        # also runs `prisma generate`
npm run db:migrate            # apply migrations to the local database
npm run db:seed               # create the venue and the first owner (needs SEED_OWNER_* in .env)
npm run dev                   # http://localhost:3001/health
```

If port 5432 is already taken (for example by a local Postgres), set `POSTGRES_PORT=5434` in `.env` and use the same port in `DATABASE_URL`; Docker Compose reads `.env` for the port mapping.

The app validates its environment at boot (`src/shared/config/env.ts`) and exits with a list of invalid keys when something is missing.

## Architecture rules

- Screaming + hexagonal: business code lives in `src/modules/<module>/{domain,application,infrastructure,http}`. See [`src/modules/README.md`](src/modules/README.md).
- Cross-cutting code lives in `src/shared/` (config, HTTP helpers, Prisma).
- `domain/` has no Nest, Prisma, or Zod imports.
- Zod validates input only at the HTTP boundary, through `ZodValidationPipe` (`src/shared/http/zod-validation.pipe.ts`), which answers `400` with flattened issues.
- Prisma models are added to `prisma/schema.prisma` by the module that owns them. The connection URL is read from `prisma.config.ts`.
- `GET /health` is a database-free liveness probe, so the e2e test runs without PostgreSQL.

## Auth (staff sessions)

Own session auth, no JWT. `src/modules/auth` stores sessions in PostgreSQL and hands the browser an opaque token in the `cp_session` cookie (`HttpOnly`, `SameSite=Lax`, `Secure` in production, path `/`). Only SHA-256 hashes of session and reset tokens are stored; passwords use argon2id.

| Endpoint                     | Body                              | Response                                                                 |
| ---------------------------- | --------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `POST /auth/login`           | `{ email, password, remember? }`  | `200 { status: "authenticated", staff }` or `200 { status: "mfa_required" }`; `401 invalid_credentials` |
| `POST /auth/mfa/verify`      | `{ code }` (6 digits, TOTP)       | `200 { status: "authenticated", staff }`; `401 invalid_mfa_code \| invalid_session` |
| `POST /auth/logout`          | —                                 | `204`, clears the cookie                                                 |
| `GET /auth/me`               | —                                 | `200 { staff }`; `401 invalid_session`                                   |
| `POST /auth/password/forgot` | `{ email }`                       | always `202` (no account probing)                                        |
| `POST /auth/password/reset`  | `{ token, password }`             | `204`, revokes every session; `400 invalid_reset_token \| weak_password` (`requirements`) |

- `staff` is `{ id, email, name, role }`, with `role` one of `OWNER`, `MANAGER`, `STAFF`.
- MFA is TOTP (authenticator app). Users with `mfaSecret` get a 10-minute `mfa_pending` session from login; verifying rotates it into a new authenticated session. Seed with `SEED_OWNER_MFA=true` to enroll the owner and print the `otpauth://` URI.
- `remember: true` makes the cookie persistent (`Max-Age` = `SESSION_TTL_HOURS`); otherwise it is a browser-session cookie. The server expires sessions after `SESSION_TTL_HOURS` either way.
- Reset links point to `<ADMIN_URL>/reset-password?token=…` and expire after 15 minutes. In development the `ConsoleMailer` prints them to the API log; replace it with a real mail adapter before production.
- Password rules mirror the admin reset screen: 6+ characters, no other strength rules (`src/modules/auth/domain/password-policy.ts`).
- Login, verify, forgot and reset are rate limited per IP with `@nestjs/throttler`.
- Other modules protect routes with `@UseGuards(SessionGuard)` and read the user with `@CurrentStaff()` (import `AuthModule`).

## Venue (profile and payment settings)

`src/modules/venue` holds the single café: one `venues` row with id `main`, created by the seed (both clients model one café). Admin routes use `SessionGuard`; any signed-in staff role may edit, because the admin has no role restriction on these screens.

| Endpoint                       | Auth  | Body → response |
| ------------------------------ | ----- | --------------- |
| `GET /venue`                   | —     | `200 VenueProfile & { openStatus }`; `404 venue_not_configured` before seeding |
| `PUT /venue`                   | staff | `VenueProfile` → `200` as `GET`; `400 invalid_venue_profile` with `issues: [{ path, code }]` |
| `GET /venue/payment-options`   | —     | `200 { requestModes }`, the enabled modes in display order |
| `GET /venue/payment-settings`  | staff | `200 { settings, version, updatedAt }` |
| `PUT /venue/payment-settings`  | staff | `settings` → `200 { settings, version, updatedAt }`; `400 invalid_payment_settings` with `issues` and `bankAccount` field codes |

- `VenueProfile` mirrors the web `CafeDetail`: `{ name, description, coverImageUrl, address: { street, city, mapsUrl } | null, contact: { whatsapp, phone }, links: [{ network, handle, url }], timezone, openingHours: [{ weekday, opensAt, closesAt }] }`. `network` is `instagram`, `facebook` or `website`; `weekday` is `monday`…`sunday`; times are `"HH:MM"`. Missing weekdays are closed; ranges past midnight are not supported. Link and map URLs must be http(s).
- `openStatus` is computed in the venue `timezone`: `{ open: true, closesAt }`, `{ open: false, reopensOn, reopensAt }`, or `null` without hours. Clients format the copy ("Abierto hasta 20:00", "mañana a las 08:00").
- `settings` mirrors the admin `PaymentSettings`: `{ methods: { cash, card, transfer, other }, requestModes: { table, register, transfer }, bankAccount: { holder, bank, alias, cbu, staffInstructions } }`, with a boolean per method and mode. The web app calls `register` "cashier".
- Rules mirror `admin/src/features/payments/payment-settings.ts`: at least one method; the transfer request mode needs the transfer method; the bank account is always validated (holder and bank required, alias of 6–20 `[A-Za-z0-9.-]`, CBU/CVU of 22 digits with both check digits, staff instructions up to 120 characters). Saving an unchanged draft keeps the version.
- Bank details are never public: the web bill screen only lets customers pick a request mode, and staff share the transfer data.

## Tables (configuration and QR credentials)

`src/modules/tables` holds the table configuration the admin edits on `/tables/management` and `/tables/qr`: spaces, tables, their floor-plan box and their QR credentials. Live service (table sessions, orders, bills) is not here yet. Admin routes use `SessionGuard` (any staff role); every admin mutation answers the full updated configuration.

| Endpoint                               | Auth  | Body → response |
| -------------------------------------- | ----- | --------------- |
| `GET /tables/qr?number=07&token=…`     | —     | `200 { number, label, spaceName }`; `404 table_not_found` unless the table is enabled and the token is its active credential (no reason given) |
| `GET /tables/config`                   | staff | `200 Configuration` |
| `POST /tables/spaces`                  | staff | `{ name, icon?, tone? }` → `201 Configuration`; `400 invalid_space` |
| `PATCH /tables/spaces/:spaceId`        | staff | `{ name, icon?, tone? }` → `200`; `400 invalid_space`, `404 space_not_found` |
| `POST /tables/spaces/:spaceId/move`    | staff | `{ direction: "up" \| "down" }` → `200` (no change at either end) |
| `DELETE /tables/spaces/:spaceId`       | staff | `200`; `409 space_not_removable` with `reason: "space_has_tables" \| "last_space"` and `tableCount` |
| `POST /tables`                         | staff | `{ label, spaceId, capacity, description, enabled, shape? }` → `201`; `400 invalid_table` |
| `PATCH /tables/:tableId`               | staff | `{ label, spaceId, capacity, description, enabled }` → `200`; `400 invalid_table`, `409 table_has_open_session` when disabling |
| `POST /tables/:tableId/enable` · `/disable` | staff | `200`; disable: `409 table_has_open_session` |
| `DELETE /tables/:tableId`              | staff | `200`; `409 table_has_open_session \| table_has_history` |
| `PUT /tables/:tableId/position`        | staff | `{ x, y }` → `200`; `409 table_overlap` with `conflict: { id, number, label }` |
| `PUT /tables/:tableId/size`            | staff | `{ x, y, width, height }` (integers) → `200`; `409 table_overlap` |
| `PUT /tables/:tableId/shape`           | staff | `{ shape: "rect" \| "round" }` → `200` |
| `POST /tables/:tableId/qr/regenerate`  | staff | `200`; the old token stops resolving |

- `Configuration` is `{ spaces: Space[], tables: Table[] }`: spaces in display order, tables by number. `Space` is `{ id, name, icon, tone }` with `icon` one of `store`, `sun`, `trees`, `map-pin` and `tone` one of `brand`, `warning`, `success`, `neutral`. `Table` is `{ id, number, label, spaceId, capacity, description, enabled, version, layout: { x, y, width, height, shape }, qr, revokedQrs }`, where `qr` is `{ token, issuedAt, issuedBy: { id, name } }` or `null` and `revokedQrs` (newest first) add `revokedAt` and `auditNumber`.
- Unknown space or table ids answer `404 space_not_found` / `table_not_found`. `400` errors carry `issues: [{ path, code }]` with `code` one of `required`, `too_long`, `duplicate`, `unknown_space`, `out_of_range`; `409` means the current configuration forbids the change.
- Rules mirror `admin/src/features/venue/{space-config,table-config,table-removal,table-layout}.ts`: space names up to 24 characters, labels up to 30, both unique ignoring case, spaces and accents; capacity an integer from 1 to 20; description up to 60 characters. A space is deleted only without tables and when it is not the last one. Disabling or deleting a table is refused while a session is open; a table that ever had a session can only be disabled. Sessions do not exist yet, so the `TableActivity` adapter reports none.
- Floor plan: each space has a 780×620 plan. A move snaps to the 8px grid and is clamped inside the plan; a resize is clamped to the plan and to the minimum box the table's seats need. Overlapping another table of the same space is refused. A new table, or one moved to another space, takes the first free spot of the 4-column grid.
- Ids are internal (`tbl_07`, space slugs such as `barra-alta`); the public identity is the table `number`, assigned as the highest number ever used plus one, so deleted numbers are never reused.
- QR tokens are 10 random alphanumeric characters (`node:crypto`), unique across every credential ever issued. Regenerating revokes the active credential with the next audit number (`QR-119` after `QR-118`); disabling keeps the credential (paused); deleting the table revokes it and keeps the row, so its token and number never come back. `issuedBy` is the signed-in staff member.
- `version` is display and audit only (no optimistic concurrency): editing the form always bumps it; enable/disable, layout and regenerate bump it when something changes.
- The seed creates the admin mock configuration (3 spaces, 12 tables with their fixed QR tokens, Mesa 07's audited rotation) only when there is no table configuration yet; its credentials are issued by the seeded owner.

## Notes

- The project is ESM (`"type": "module"`, `nodenext`): relative imports use the `.js` extension.
- Tests compile with SWC (`unplugin-swc`) because Nest dependency injection needs decorator metadata.
- `overrides.multer` pins a patched multer until `@nestjs/platform-express` ships it.
